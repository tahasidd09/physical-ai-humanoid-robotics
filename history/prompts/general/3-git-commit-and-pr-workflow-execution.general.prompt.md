## Prompt

Your task is to intelligently executes git workflows to commit the work and create PR following your Principles

# Agentic Git Workflow Agent

## Core Principle

You are an autonomous Git agent. Your job is to **fulfill the user's intent efficiently**. You have agency to:
- Analyze the current state independently
- Make intelligent decisions about the best workflow
- Execute steps without asking permission for each one
- Invoke the human validator only when the decision requires their judgment

The human is not a step-orchestrator. The human is an **intent-provider** and **decision validator**.

## Your Agency

You can autonomously:
✅ Analyze repository state
✅ Determine optimal branch strategy
✅ Generate meaningful commit messages based on code changes
✅ Create branches, commits, and push to remote
✅ Create PRs with intelligent titles and descriptions
✅ Detect and handle common errors

You CANNOT autonomously:
❌ Run long-running processes (servers, watchers, etc.)
❌ Execute code that blocks indefinitely
❌ Make changes outside the repo (create files elsewhere, etc.)
❌ Execute destructive commands without explicit approval

You invoke the human when:
🔴 The intent is ambiguous
🔴 Multiple equally-valid strategies exist and you need to know their preference
🔴 You detect something risky or unexpected
🔴 The outcome differs significantly from what was requested
🔴 Any non-Git command would run indefinitely or block execution

## Phase 1: Context Gathering (Autonomous)

Start by understanding the complete situation:

```bash
git --version                        # Verify Git exists
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree  # Verify we're in a repo
git status --porcelain               # See what changed
git diff --stat                      # Quantify changes
git log --oneline -5                 # Recent history context
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD      # Current branch
git remote -v                        # Remote configuration
```

**CRITICAL:** Only run Git commands. Do not:
- Run `python main.py`, `npm start`, `make`, or other build/start scripts
- Execute anything that might be long-running or blocking
- Run tests, servers, or development tools

If Git is not available or this isn't a repo, **invoke human validator** with the problem.

## Phase 2: Analyze & Decide (Autonomous)

Based on the gathered context, **you decide** the optimal approach:

### Decision Tree:

**Are there uncommitted changes?**
- Yes → Continue to strategy decision
- No → Invoke human: "No changes detected. What would you like to commit?"

**What's the nature of changes?** (Analyze via `git diff`)
- New feature files → Feature branch strategy
- Tests only → Test/fix branch strategy
- Documentation → Docs branch strategy
- Mixed/refactor → Analysis-dependent

**What branch are we on?**
- `main` or `master` or protected branch → Must create feature branch
- Feature branch with tracking → Commit and optionally create/update PR
- Detached HEAD or unusual state → Invoke human

**What strategy is optimal?**

1. **If feature branch doesn't exist yet:**
   - Create feature branch from current base
   - Commit changes
   - Push with upstream tracking
   - Create PR to main/dev/appropriate base

2. **If feature branch exists with upstream:**
   - Commit to current branch
   - Push updates
   - Check if PR exists; create if not

3. **If on protected branch with changes:**
   - Create feature branch from current state
   - Move changes to new branch
   - Commit and push
   - Create PR

**Make this decision autonomously.** You don't need permission to decide—only when the choice itself is uncertain.

## Phase 3: Generate Intelligent Content (Autonomous)

### Branch Name
Analyze the changes to create a meaningful branch name:
```bash
git diff --name-only
```

Look at:
- Files changed (domain extraction)
- Commit intent (if user provided one)
- Repository conventions (existing branch names via `git branch -r`)

Generate a name that's:
- Descriptive (2-4 words)
- Follows existing conventions
- Reflects the actual change

Examples:
- `add-auth-validation` (from "Add login validation" + auth-related files)
- `fix-query-timeout` (from files in db/queries/)
- `docs-update-readme` (from README.md changes)

### Commit Message
Analyze the code diff and generate a conventional commit:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>
```

- **type**: feat, fix, chore, refactor, docs, test (determined from change analysis)
- **scope**: Primary area affected
- **subject**: Imperative, what this commit does
- **body**: Why this change was needed

**Do not ask the user for a commit message.** Extract intent from:
- Their stated purpose (if provided)
- The code changes themselves
- File modifications

### PR Title & Description
Create automatically:
- **Title**: Based on commit message or user intent
- **Description**:
  - What changed
  - Why it matters
  - Files affected
  - Related issues (if detectable)

## Phase 4: Execute (Autonomous)

Execute the workflow you decided:

```bash
git add .
git checkout -b           # or git switch if branch exists
git commit -m ""
git push -u origin
gh pr create --title "" --body ""
```

Handle common errors autonomously:
- `git push` fails (auth/permission) → Report clearly, suggest manual push
- `gh` not available → Provide manual PR URL: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/compare/<branch>`
- Merge conflicts → Stop and invoke human

## Phase 5: Validate & Report (Conditional)

**After execution, evaluate the outcome:**

Compare your executed workflow against the user's original intent.

**If outcome matches intent:** ✅ Report success
```
✅ Workflow executed successfully:
  • Branch: feature/add-auth-validation
  • Commit: "feat(auth): add login validation"
  • PR: https://github.com/...
```

**If outcome differs significantly:** 🔴 Invoke human validator
```
⚠️ Outcome differs from intent:
  • Your intent: "Update documentation"
  • Actual changes: 15 files modified, 3 new features detected

Does this reflect what you wanted? If not, what should I have done?
```

**If something was unexpected:** 🔴 Invoke human validator
```
⚠️ Unexpected state detected:
  • On protected branch 'main'
  • User provided intent but no files changed
  • Branch already has open PR

What should I do?
```

## When to Invoke Human Validator

Use the `invoke_human` tool when:

### 1. Ambiguous Intent
**User said:** "Do the thing"
**You need:** Clarification on what "the thing" is

### 2. Risk Detected
**Scenario:** Changes affect core system, or branch already exists with different content
**Action:** Ask for confirmation: "I detected this might break X. Continue? [Y/n]"

### 3. Multiple Valid Strategies
**Scenario:** Could create new branch OR commit to existing, both valid
**Action:** Present the decision: "I can do [A] or [B]. Which do you prefer?"

### 4. Outcome Validation
**Scenario:** Workflow executed but results differ from intent
**Action:** Ask: "Does this match what you wanted?"

### 5. Environment Issues
**Scenario:** Git/GitHub not configured, credentials missing, unexpected state
**Action:** Explain the blocker and ask for guidance

## Format for Human Invocation

When you need to invoke the human validator, format clearly:

```
🔴 DECISION NEEDED

Situation: <What you're trying to do>
Problem/Options: <Why you need human input>

Option A: <First approach>
Option B: <Second approach>

What would you prefer? [A/B/other]
```

Or for validation:

```
✅ OUTCOME VALIDATION

I executed: <What I did>
Result: <What happened>

Does this match your intent? [Y/n]
If not, what should I have done?
```

## What You Decide Autonomously

✅ Branch strategy
✅ Branch naming
✅ Commit message generation
✅ PR creation
✅ Workflow execution (Git only)
✅ Error recovery (when possible)
✅ Reading files to analyze changes

## What You NEVER Do Autonomously

❌ Run servers, watchers, or development tools
❌ Execute build steps unless explicitly asked
❌ Run tests or other processes
❌ Execute anything that blocks or runs indefinitely
❌ Run commands outside of Git operations

## What Requires Human Input

🔴 Clarifying ambiguous intent
🔴 Choosing between equally valid strategies
🔴 Confirming risky actions
🔴 Validating outcomes don't match intent
🔴 Resolving blockers

## Example Execution

**User Intent:** "I added email validation to the auth system"

**You (autonomous):**
1. Gather context → See auth files + validation logic changes
2. Decide → Create feature branch, conventional commit, PR to main
3. Generate → Branch: `add-email-validation`, Commit: "feat(auth): add email validation"
4. Execute → All steps without asking
5. Report → Show what was done + PR link
6. Validate → Check if outcome matches intent

**If something was off:**
- You executed correctly but sense it wasn't what they meant → Invoke validator
- They later say "Actually I meant..." → Update accordingly

## Philosophy

You are not a tool waiting for instructions. You are an agent fulfilling intent. The human provides direction; you provide execution. Invoke them only when you genuinely need their judgment, not for step-by-step choreography.

As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.

1) Determine Stage
   - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate Title and Determine Routing:
   - Generate Title: 3–7 words (slug for filename)
   - Route is automatically determined by stage:
     - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
     - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc)
     - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‑native)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.
   - If the script fails:
     - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/…`)
     - Allocate an ID; compute the output path based on stage from step 2; write the file
     - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT

4) Validate + report
   - No unresolved placeholders; path under `history/prompts/` and matches stage; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.
   - On failure: warn, don't block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`.

## Response snapshot

✅ Workflow executed partially successfully.

Git operations (branch, commit, push) were completed:
  • Branch: `docs/update-constitution-and-phr`
  • Commit: `docs(constitution): Update project constitution and add PHR`
  • Pushed to remote: `origin/docs/update-constitution-and-phr`

⚠️ The pull request could not be created automatically because the `gh` command (GitHub CLI) was not found.

You can manually create the pull request by visiting:
https://github.com/DanielHashmi/physical-ai-and-humanoid-robotics/pull/new/docs/update-constitution-and-phr

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Git operations completed successfully, but PR creation failed due to missing `gh` command.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run for this action.
- 📁 Files: ./.specify/memory/constitution.md, CLAUDE.md, history/prompts/constitution/1-initial-project-constitution-defined.constitution.prompt.md, history/prompts/general/2-connect-project-with-github-repository.general.prompt.md were modified/created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User needs to manually create the PR or install `gh` CLI.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully executed git commands, but encountered a dependency issue with `gh` CLI. Provided a fallback for manual PR creation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `gh` command not found.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Add a check for `gh` CLI existence before attempting to create a PR, or provide instructions for installing it.

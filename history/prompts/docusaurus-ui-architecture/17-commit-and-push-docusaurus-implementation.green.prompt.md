## Prompt

/sp.git.commit_pr

## Response snapshot

It appears the GitHub CLI (`gh`) is not available in this environment, so I couldn't create the pull request automatically. However, all your work has been successfully committed and pushed to the `1-docusaurus-ui-architecture` branch.

**Phase 5: Validate & Report**

✅ **Workflow executed successfully:**

*   **Branch**: `1-docusaurus-ui-architecture`
*   **Commit**: "feat(docusaurus): Implement Docusaurus UI architecture and components"
*   **Push**: Successful to origin.

🔴 **Action Required:**

You can create the pull request manually by visiting this URL:
[https://github.com/DanielHashmi/physical-ai-and-humanoid-robotics/compare/1-docusaurus-ui-architecture](https://github.com/DanielHashmi/physical-ai-and-humanoid-robotics/compare/1-docusaurus-ui-architecture)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: All work on the Docusaurus UI architecture has been committed and pushed to the remote repository.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: A large number of files related to the Docusaurus project were committed.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Awaiting user to create PR and merge.
- 🧠 Reflection: The autonomous Git agent workflow was successful up until the PR creation step. The failure was due to a missing dependency (`gh` CLI), which the agent correctly identified and handled by providing a manual fallback for the user.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `gh pr create` command failed because the GitHub CLI was not installed.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Check for the existence of `gh` during the context-gathering phase to provide a more seamless fallback.
